## ImpactChain – What is Our Idea?

Building a blockchain-based donation platform where users can donate cryptocurrency directly to charities via smart contracts on a testnet blockchain (Polygon Amoy). The platform offers transparency by recording every donation on-chain, allowing donors and charities to verify transactions without intermediaries. We want donors to be able to see how their contributions are helping, and incentivize orgs to share their progress by having them show their progress off-chain (Proof of Donation Impact). This project showcases how blockchain can enable trustless, secure, and transparent giving.

## Problem in the Status Quo

Traditional donation platforms often lack transparency and trust—users can't easily verify if their donations reach the intended recipients or how funds are used. Furthermore, users want to see how their donations are being spent. There are many instances of orgs/individuals not spending as initially promised. 

Additionally, many platforms rely on centralized intermediaries, which introduce delays, fees, and potential censorship. Crypto donations are growing but are often complex for non-technical users, with friction in wallet setup, token choice, and fees.

### Common Sources of Donations + Their Problems

- In-Person Donations: Usually processed via credit cards or cash, requiring centralized payment processors with limited transparency on fund flow beyond the initial transaction
- Online Donations via Fiat: Centralized payment gateways with potential delays, fees, and limited donor visibility into fund allocation
- Social Campaigns (GoFundMe): Trust depends on individual claims; little to no proof of spend
